/**
 * An abstract base ViewModel class implementing the MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture pattern.
 *
 * StateViewModel provides the core infrastructure for managing application state in a reactive,
 * unidirectional way. It handles the complete MVI flow: Actions → Events → State Changes → Effects.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Type-safe state management with StateFlow
 * - Reactive action processing with coroutines
 * - Automatic state updates based on events
 * - Side effect handling with Flow
 * - Built-in error handling and lifecycle management
 *
 * The MVI flow in this ViewModel:
 * 1. UI sends Actions via handleAction()
 * 2. Actions are processed into Events via processAction()
 * 3. Events are reduced to new States via reduce()
 * 4. Events can optionally produce Effects via handleEvent()
 * 5. UI observes State changes and Effects
 *
 * @param S The type of the component's state - represents the current UI state
 * @param A The type of the user action - represents user intents and interactions
 * @param V The type of the event - represents internal events that trigger state changes
 * @param F The type of the effect - represents one-time side effects (navigation, toasts, etc.)
 *
 * Example implementation:
 * ```kotlin
 * class CounterViewModel : StateViewModel<CounterState, CounterAction, CounterEvent, CounterEffect>(
 *     initialState = CounterState(count = 0)
 * ) {
 *     override suspend fun processAction(action: CounterAction): CounterEvent = when (action) {
 *         CounterAction.Increment -> CounterEvent.Incremented
 *         CounterAction.Decrement -> CounterEvent.Decremented
 *         CounterAction.Reset -> CounterEvent.Reset
 *     }
 *
 *     override fun CounterState.reduce(event: CounterEvent): CounterState = when (event) {
 *         CounterEvent.Incremented -> copy(count = count + 1)
 *         CounterEvent.Decremented -> copy(count = count - 1)
 *         CounterEvent.Reset -> copy(count = 0)
 *     }
 *
 *     override suspend fun handleEvent(event: CounterEvent): CounterEffect? = when (event) {
 *         CounterEvent.Incremented -> if (state.value.count >= 10) CounterEffect.ShowMaxReached else null
 *         else -> null
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param initialState The initial state of the component
 * @param defaultDispatcher The default coroutine dispatcher that the ViewModel will use
