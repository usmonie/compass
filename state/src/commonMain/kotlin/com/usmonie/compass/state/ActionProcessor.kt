/**
 * Interface for processing user actions into events in the MVI architecture.
 *
 * This component is responsible for converting user intents (Actions) into internal events
 * that represent what should happen in response to those actions. It acts as the business
 * logic layer that processes user interactions.
 *
 * @param Action The type of user actions that this processor can handle
 * @param State The type of the current application state
 * @param Event The type of events that this processor produces
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val processor = ActionProcessor<CounterAction, CounterState, CounterEvent> { scope, action, state ->
 *     when (action) {
 *         CounterAction.Increment -> CounterEvent.Incremented
 *         CounterAction.Decrement -> CounterEvent.Decremented
 *         CounterAction.Reset -> CounterEvent.Reset
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
